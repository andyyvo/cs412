 * Problem 2
 *
 * Write a function that takes as its input the following formatted strings:
 * '4+2'
 * '5*7'
 * '6-1'
 * '9/2'
 * '2^8' (where ^ is exponentiation)
 *
 * This function should
 * Determine the operator (+, *, -, ^, or /) embedded in the string
 * Return a function to implement the input operator that returns the result
 *
 * For example, if the input string is ‘8%3’, return (left, right) => left % right
 * Execute the returned function to evaluate and print each expression.
